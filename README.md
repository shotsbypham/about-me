## About Me

Hello, my name is Trina Pham and I am building a About me project
My about me page is a self-introduction of who I am. It includes hobbies, education history, volunteer experience, and my favorite video games. It also includes a little questionaire about who I am.

### Reflections and Comments

* What I noticed that helped me the most with a while loops is making the content first then plugging it in after. For my seventh question, I created an if statement, then a for loop, then plugged it into my while loop.
* Another useful tip is to draw the code out as a diagram or a drawing to map everything out.
