  <h2>hobbies:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>coding: coding is one of my newest hobbies. my interest in code started back in january where i saw the lives
      that other software engineers/developers were living and it was the lifestyle that i wanted.</li>
    <li>photography: photography is a hobby i picked up in high school, i just loved taking pictures of my friends and
      help them love themselves. when you have a picture you like of yourself, it just makes you feel good in general.
    </li>
    <li>gaming: gaming is a hobby i picked up at the start of covid and it has stuck with me for a while. gaming is an
      escape from reality for me and i really enjoy it overall. there is also a huge community behind the gaming world
      and it's a nice way to make friends.</li>
    <li>building keyboards: building keyboards is a very rare hobby to have i would like to think, not many people know
      how keyboards work let alone know how to build them. i build custom mechancial keyboards as a hobby and i think
      it's my biggest geeky facts about me.</li>
