    <h2>self-introduction:</h2>
    <script>askName();</script>
    <p>my name is trina pham and i'm a student in code 201 @ code fellows! my education history is i did 2 1/2 years of my undergraduate program as a asian american studies/political science major, but dropped out because i was no longer passionate about it. prior to this class, the only coding experience i have is the code 102 class. through this program, i want to have the capability to know how to code and understand java/javascript in general.</p>
    <h2>hobbies:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>coding: coding is one of my newest hobbies. my interest in code started back in january where i saw the lives that other software engineers/developers were living and it was the lifestyle that i wanted.</li>
      <li>photography: photography is a hobby i picked up in high school, i just loved taking pictures of my friends and help them love themselves. when you have a picture you like of yourself, it just makes you feel good in general.</li>
      <li>gaming: gaming is a hobby i picked up at the start of covid and it has stuck with me for a while. gaming is an escape from reality for me and i really enjoy it overall. there is also a huge community behind the gaming world and it's a nice way to make friends.</li>
      <li>building keyboards: building keyboards is a very rare hobby to have i would like to think, not many people know how keyboards work let alone know how to build them. i build custom mechancial keyboards as a hobby and i think it's my biggest geeky facts about me.</li>
